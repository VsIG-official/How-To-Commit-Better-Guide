Looks great, right? Here's how you can make yours great too:
 


    > Separate the subject from the body with a blank line
    > Your commit message should not contain any whitespace errors
    > Remove unnecessary punctuation marks
    > Do not end the subject line with a period
    > Capitalize the subject line and each paragraph
    > Use the imperative mood in the subject line
    > Use the body to explain what changes you have made and why you made them.
    > Do not assume the reviewer understands what the original problem was, ensure you add it.
    > Do not think your code is self-explanatory
    > Follow the commit convention defined by your team

### Description

> This is My guide "How to write good commits". There You'll find some useful stuff to write Your commits better

#Git #Commit

## Tips

1. Commit early, commit often

It all starts with frequency. If you are starting out fresh with Git, then you should be committing early and often to your changes. Do it until it becomes second nature. When you add a method, commit. When you change something, commit. Did you rename some files? Commit. You know that floppy disk we call a save button? When you get to the point of committing your code as often as you are saving your Word documents, only then can you start winding back to a more comfortable cadence.

2. Make your commit messages meaningful using a semantic style

Imagine a box. You can put stuff into the box. You can take stuff out of the box. This box is the staging area of Git. You can craft commits here. Committing commits is like sealing that box and sticking a label on it. The contents of that box are your changes. So, why not have the label mean something? You wouldn’t label a moving box with kitchen items “stuff.”

Commit message composition is just as important as naming your variables and methods. If you’re following the first tip above, it’s very tempting to label a commit as simply “changes” or “savepoint.” Don’t fall into that hole.

 Specify the type of commit:

    - feat: The new feature you're adding to a particular application
    > feat: add beta sequence
    - fix: A bug fix
    > fix: remove broken confirmation message
    - style: Feature and updates related to styling
    > style: convert tabs to spaces
    - refactor: Refactoring a specific section of the codebase
    > refactor: share logic between 4d3d3d3 and flarhgunnstow
    - test: Everything related to testing
    > test: ensure Tayne retains clothing
    - docs: Everything related to documentation
    > docs: explain hat wobble
    - chore: Regular code maintenance
    > chore: add Oyster build script
    [ You can also use emojis to represent commit types]
